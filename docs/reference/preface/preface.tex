\section*{Welcome}
The goal of this manual is to provide you with a quick reference to the syntax, 
semantics and features of the experimental Scout language.  We assume that the
reader is an experienced programmer with a basic understanding of parallel 
computing.  Although we do our best to keep the language documentation up to 
date with the feature set supported by the open-source versions of Scout, readers
are encouraged to look over the release notes provided with each version for 
important details.

\section*{About Source Code Listings}

The source code listings in this manual uses both font changes and \textit{syntax aware} 
coloring that helps the reader to identify parts of the language.  Table~\ref{src_listing_table}
provides a key to the font and colors using in the listings.
