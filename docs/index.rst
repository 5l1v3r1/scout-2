Overview
========

The Scout project is an effort to explore the use of language-level
constructs for in situ data analysis and visualization.  We rely
heavily on the LLVM compiler infrastructure and its subprojects
including Clang and the compiler-rt library.  This documentation is
broken down into several sections focused on different audiences:

Contents:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   build
   tests
   devels
   runtime
   todos
