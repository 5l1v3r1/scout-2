The Scout Programming Language 
==============================

This directory and its subdirectories contain the source code for the
Scout Programming Language, a domain-specific language for mesh-based
data analysis, and visualization.  Scout relies heavily on LLVM (Low
Level Virtual Machine) and Clang projects.  For more information on
LLVM and Clang visit the website: http://llvm.org. 

Scout is open source software. It is released under the terms of the
license agreement found in the LICENSE.txt file.  Please see the
documentation provided in docs/index.html for further details on the
language.
