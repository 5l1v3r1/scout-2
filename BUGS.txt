The Scout Programming Language

Until we managed to get a bug tracking system in place please
use this file to track known bugs you encounter within the 
code.  


-- Semantic checks of following need to be added:

   * accessing incorrect mesh element fields within forall
     statements.  For example, accessing c.height (or 
     c.position.y) for a 1D mesh should result in an error.  

-- Mesh types as function parameters. 

   * It appears that we can't pass a mesh instance to functions.
