The Scout Programming Language
==============================

Until we managed to get a bug tracking system in place please
use this file to track known bugs you encounter within the 
code.  


-- Semantic checks of following need to be added:

   * accessing incorrect mesh element fields within forall
     statements.  For example, accessing c.height (or 
     c.position.y) for a 1D mesh should result in an error.  

-- Mesh types as function parameters. 

   * It appears that we can't pass a mesh instance to functions. 

-- hwloc not being found on some systems (likely those that do not 
   have an already installed version) 

   * We should make sure scc knows to find hwloc in the build/install
     directory structure.
  
-- PNG builds broken on some Linux systems. 

   * Apparent API differences within libpng versions are a stumbling
     block for building on some platforms -- we've currently disabled
     PNG support until we can address this (currently a lower priority
     concern).
