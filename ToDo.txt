*** Build System 

 1. We need to add a flag to scc that allows us to disable the use
    of the standard library -- this will be necessary to bootstrap 
    the building of the standard library with scc... [DONE] 

 2. We currently can't build on a system w/out hwloc installed. The
    current configuration will proceed and produce a makefiles but 
    bad things eventually happen on systems w/out hwloc... 

 3. Explore the use of -rpath on our command line to avoid having 
    to set (DY)LD_LIBRARY_PATH for scout-produced executables. This
    may not be something we always want but it might be very helpful 
    during development.  For reference:

       During development, there's the potential problem of modifying
       a library that's also used by many other programs -- and you
       don't want the other programs to use the ``developmental''
       library, only a particular application that you're testing
       against it. One link option you might use is ld's ``rpath''
       option, which specifies the runtime library search path of that
       particular program being compiled. From gcc, you can invoke the
       rpath option by specifying it this way:

           -Wl,-rpath,$(DEFAULT_LIB_INSTALL_PATH) 

       If you use this option when building the library client
       program, you don't need to bother with LD_LIBRARY_PATH
       (described next) other than to ensure it's not conflicting, or
       using other techniques to hide the library.

 4. FindSDL modules appears broken -- not exited upon failure (REQUIRED
    ignored?). [DONE]

 5. Update documentation to match new build configuration process.
